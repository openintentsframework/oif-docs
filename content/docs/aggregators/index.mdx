# Aggregators

The OIF Aggregator provides quote aggregation from multiple solvers, intent routing, and order tracking for the Open Intents Framework.

## Why Run an Aggregator?

- **Control**: Full control over solver selection and routing logic
- **Privacy**: Keep user intents private within your infrastructure
- **Customization**: Implement custom quote selection and solver scoring
- **Reliability**: Eliminate dependence on third-party services
