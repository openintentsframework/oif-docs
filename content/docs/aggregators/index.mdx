# OIF Aggregator

A high-performance aggregator for Open Intent Framework (OIF) solvers, providing quote aggregation, intent submission, and solver management.

## Features

### Core Capabilities

- Multi-Solver Quote Aggregation - Fetch quotes from multiple DeFi solvers concurrently
- ERC-7930 Compliance - Full support for the Open Intent Framework standard
- Intent-Based Architecture - Submit intents and track execution through to settlement
- Integrity Verification - HMAC-SHA256 checksums prevent quote tampering
- Circuit Breaker Protection - Automatic failure detection and recovery for failing solvers
- Performance Metrics - Real-time solver performance monitoring and analytics
- Flexible Storage - In-memory storage backend
- Rate Limiting - Built-in IP-based rate limiting

### Extensibility

- Custom Adapters - Easily integrate new solver protocols
- Builder Pattern - Flexible programmatic configuration
- Pluggable Authentication - Multiple auth strategies (API keys, none, custom)
- Configurable Timeouts - Per-solver and global timeout management

### Performance & Reliability

- Async/Await - Built on Tokio for high concurrency
- Circuit Breaker Pattern - Prevents cascading failures with exponential backoff
- Solver Health Monitoring - Real-time success rates and error tracking
- Smart Filtering - Intelligent solver selection based on performance metrics
- Error Handling - Comprehensive error types and recovery
- Structured Logging - JSON and pretty-print log formats

## API Endpoints

Once running, the following endpoints are available:

- `GET /health` - Health check
- `POST /v1/quotes` - Get quotes from multiple solvers
- `POST /v1/orders` - Submit order for execution
- `GET /v1/orders/{id}` - Get order
- `GET /v1/solvers` - List all solvers
- `GET /v1/solvers/{id}` - Get solver details
- `GET /swagger-ui` - Swagger UI - Available when run with openapi feature
- `GET /api-docs/openapi.json` - OpenAPI specification - Available when run with openapi feature

For interactive API documentation, run with `--features openapi`.
