## TL;DR

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openintentsframework/oif-aggregator.git
cd oif-aggregator
export INTEGRITY_SECRET="your-secure-random-string-minimum-32-chars"
cp config/config.example.json config/config.json
cargo run
```

## Setup Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/openintentsframework/oif-aggregator.git
   cd oif-aggregator
   ```

2. **Set the Integrity Secret**:
   Set the required environment variable for HMAC-SHA256 quote verification:

   ```bash
   export INTEGRITY_SECRET="your-secure-random-string-minimum-32-chars"
   ```

   Ensure the secret is at least 32 characters for security.

3. **Configure the Application**:
   Copy the example configuration and customize as needed:

   ```bash
   cp config/config.example.json config/config.json
   ```

   Edit `config.json` for settings like port or solver endpoints (see [Configuration](/docs/aggregators/configuration) for details).

4. **Run the Aggregator**:
   Start the server:

   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

   The server runs on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

5. **Test the Setup**:
   Verify the aggregator is running by sending a request to its health endpoint:

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/health
   ```
