# Smart Contracts

Welcome to the OIF Smart Contracts documentation. This section covers the on-chain infrastructure that powers permissionless cross-chain intent execution.

<Callout type="warn">
**Security Warning**: This project currently uses an unaudited version of OpenZeppelin Contracts. Before any production release, it is mandatory to update to the latest audited version.
</Callout>

## What Are OIF Smart Contracts?

OIF smart contracts provide the settlement layer for cross-chain intents. They handle:
- **Intent Submission**: Users submit signed intents describing desired outcomes
- **Output Delivery**: Solvers fulfill outputs on destination chains
- **Proof Validation**: Oracle systems verify cross-chain fulfillment
- **Input Settlement**: Users' input assets are released to solvers upon validation

## Key Components

### InputSettler
Deployed on the input (source) chain, manages:
- Locking user input assets
- Validating oracle proofs of output delivery
- Releasing assets to successful solvers

**Implementations:**
- `InputSettlerCompact`: Gas-efficient using Resource Locks
- `InputSettlerEscrow`: Traditional escrow-based settlement

### OutputSettler
Deployed on the output (destination) chain, handles:
- Accepting solver fills
- Generating attestations for oracle systems
- Validating payload integrity

### Oracle
Proof layer connecting input and output chains:
- Cross-chain messaging protocols
- Optimistic proof systems
- Storage proofs or light clients

```

### Output-Input Separation

OIF fully separates input and output handling, enabling:
- **Multiple Settlement Patterns**: Escrow, Resource Locks, custom implementations
- **Flexible Oracle Systems**: Any messaging protocol or proof system
- **Bi-directional Support**: Swaps in either direction, even with asymmetric chain capabilities

## Features

### Permissionless
- No whitelisting of solvers
- Open deployment of new Settler implementations
- Composable with existing OIF infrastructure

### Multi-Chain Native
- Support for any EVM-compatible chain
- Directional proofs for asymmetric chain support

### Modular & Extensible
- Implement custom Settlers compatible with existing solvers
- Integrate any oracle or messaging protocol
- Support for multiple order types and lock mechanisms

## Use Cases

- **Cross-Chain DEX**: Enable swaps across any blockchain networks
- **Intent-Based Protocols**: Build expressive intent systems
- **L2 Bridging**: Provide instant cross-chain liquidity
- **DeFi Composability**: Chain operations across multiple chains

## Security Considerations

Key security aspects to understand:
- **First Solver Ownership**: First output filler owns the order
- **Multi-Output Risks**: DoS and price manipulation vectors
- **Callback Safety**: Arbitrary code execution during fills
- **Underwriting**: Capital rotation and risk management

See [Overview - Security Considerations](/docs/smart-contracts/overview#security-considerations) for details.

## Development Tools

OIF contracts are built with:
- **Foundry**: Fast, portable Ethereum development toolkit
- **OpenZeppelin**: Security-focused contract libraries
- **Forge**: Testing and deployment framework
