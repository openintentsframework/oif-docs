# Smart Contracts

The OIF smart contracts provide the on-chain settlement infrastructure for permissionless cross-chain intent execution.

<Callout type="warn">
**Security Warning**: This project currently uses an unaudited version of OpenZeppelin Contracts. Before any production release, it is mandatory to update to the latest audited version.
</Callout>

## What You Can Do

- **Deploy Contracts**: Set up InputSettler, OutputSettler, and Oracle contracts
- **Integrate Intents**: Build applications that submit and fulfill cross-chain intents
- **Extend the System**: Create custom Settlers compatible with existing infrastructure
- **Support Multiple Chains**: Deploy on any EVM-compatible blockchain
