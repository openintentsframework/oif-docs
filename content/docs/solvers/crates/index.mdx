# Solver Crates

This section provides in-depth documentation for each crate in the OIF Solver system. Each crate is documented with its purpose, architecture, integration patterns, and implementation guides.

## Foundation Crates

Foundation crates provide the basic building blocks used throughout the solver system.

<Cards>
  <Card title="solver-types" href="/docs/solvers/crates/solver-types" description="Foundational type system and shared data structures" />
  <Card title="solver-config" href="/docs/solvers/crates/solver-config" description="Configuration management and validation" />
</Cards>

## Business Logic Crates

<Cards>
  <Card title="solver-account" href="/docs/solvers/crates/solver-account" description="Cryptographic account management and signing operations" />
  <Card title="solver-discovery" href="/docs/solvers/crates/solver-discovery" description="Intent discovery mechanisms" />
  <Card title="solver-order" href="/docs/solvers/crates/solver-order" description="Order processing and validation" />
  <Card title="solver-pricing" href="/docs/solvers/crates/solver-pricing" description="Pricing strategies and calculations" />
</Cards>

## Infrastructure Crates

<Cards>
  <Card title="solver-delivery" href="/docs/solvers/crates/solver-delivery" description="Transaction delivery mechanisms" />
  <Card title="solver-settlement" href="/docs/solvers/crates/solver-settlement" description="Settlement coordination and monitoring" />
  <Card title="solver-storage" href="/docs/solvers/crates/solver-storage" description="Data persistence and storage backends" />
</Cards>

## Service Crates

<Cards>
  <Card title="solver-core" href="/docs/solvers/crates/solver-core" description="Core solver engine and orchestration" />
  <Card title="solver-service" href="/docs/solvers/crates/solver-service" description="HTTP API and service layer" />
</Cards>

## Architecture

All crates follow a common pattern:

1. **Purpose & Overview** - What the crate does and why it exists
2. **Core Features** - Main functionality and abstractions
3. **Integration Architecture** - How it connects to other crates
4. **Implementation Guide** - How to extend or customize
5. **Best Practices** - Common patterns and pitfalls

## Getting Started

Start with the foundation crates to understand the type system, then explore the business logic crates to see how different components work together.
